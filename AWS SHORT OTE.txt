VPC : Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. 
      This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

SUBNET :  subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You launch AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your subnets.
        You can connect a subnet to the internet, other VPCs, and your own data centers, and route traffic to and from your subnets using route tables.

Route Tables : Amazon defines A route table containing a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
              When a network packet arrives at a Router, it determines the destination IP address of a received packet and makes the routing decisions to send a packet to its destination.

IGW :  It allows communication between your VPC and the internet. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

NAT Gateway : NAT Gateway, also known as Network Address Translation Gateway, is used to enable instances present in a private subnet to help connect to the internet or AWS services.
              In addition to this, the gateway makes sure that the internet doesnâ€™t initiate a connection with the instances.

ELASTIC IP : An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
              You can associate an Elastic IP address with any instance or network interface in any VPC in your account.

VPC Peering : A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you
     		 to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.

NACL : A network access control list (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets.
